# Random-Password-Generator1
This simple random password generator was created with only one thing in mind, security. We must keep in mind many passwords and most of the time, those passwords, are not secure because a human created.

The way this works is quite simple. You can choose how many passwords would you like to create at the same time. This algorithm, divides the password into three sections separated with a score (“-“). The length of these sections can be determined by the user. The characters used include both upper and lower case letters and numbers.
